# simple-scripts
scripts I've made to make my life easier.

**4spaces1tab** - replaces each 4 spaces at the beginning of each line with one tab
Usage:


**update** - simple git add all script


**include-line** - adds a local header inclusion line to your file if it doesn't have one already.
if the filename you enter doesn't end in .h, it automatically enters main.h.
so yes you can just hit enter again if it IS main.h you want to add
